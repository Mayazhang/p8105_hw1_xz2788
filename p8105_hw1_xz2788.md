This section displays the answer to problem 1

Here is a **code chunk** that samples from a\_uniform\_distribution\_:

``` r
samp = runif(10, 0, 5)
```

Logical vector to show whether each element in the sample is greater than 2

``` r
logic_vec = samp > 2
```

creat a character vector with the length of 10

``` r
char_vec = character(length = 10)
```

creat a factor vector with the length of 10

``` r
data = c(1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 1, 1, 3, 1, 2)
factor_vec = factor(data, labels = c("I","II","III"))
```

take the mean of each variable in the dataframe

``` r
mean(samp)
```

    ## [1] 3.081458

``` r
mean(logic_vec)
```

    ## [1] 0.7

``` r
mean(char_vec)
```

    ## Warning in mean.default(char_vec): argument is not numeric or logical:
    ## returning NA

    ## [1] NA

``` r
mean(factor_vec)
```

    ## Warning in mean.default(factor_vec): argument is not numeric or logical:
    ## returning NA

    ## [1] NA

Results of taking the mean of each variable:

We can take the mean of a random sample from uniform distribution and a logical vector, but it didn't work with a character vector and a factor vector.

Explanation:

In R, mean of a vector is the average or arithmetic mean of elements in the vector.

A random sample of a uniform distribution is a numerical vector. So you can take the mean of this vector.

For a logical vector, TRUE is considered as 1 and FALSE is considered as 0 in R. So you can still take the arithmetic mean of these elements.

For a character vector, each element in the vector is a string of one or more characters instead of being considered as numbers. So R can't take the mean of characters.

Factors in R are stored as a vector of integer values with a corresponding set of character values to use when the factor is displayed. Factor's levels are always in character values and R can't take the mean of characters.
