# Section 1

This section displays the answer to problem 1

Here is a **code chunk** that samples from
a_uniform_distribution_:

```{r}
samp = runif(10, 0, 5)
```

Logical vector to show whether each element in the sample is greater than 2

```{r}
logic_vec = samp > 2
```

creat a character vector with the length of 10

```{r}
char_vec = character(length = 10)
```

creat a factor vector with the length of 10

```{r}
data = c(1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 1, 1, 3, 1, 2)
factor_data = factor(data, labels = c("I","II","III"))
```
